# Educational Problems

A collection of competitive programming problems I’ve solved, along with any new takeaways or lessons learned, and reasons I might want to revisit each problem later.

## Problem Collection

| # | Problem | Tag/Category | Difficulty | Takeaway | Revisit Note / Error Log | Code Link |
|---|-------------|--------------|------------|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2102/problem/D) | Data Structure | Div2D |  | <details><summary>View</summary>Parity dependency with inversion count</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution1.cpp) |
| 2 | [Link](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc087/tasks/arc087_b) | Dynamic Programming | Div2C-ish | <details><summary>View</summary>Multi Dimensional problems can be reduced to single dimensions if they or the operations on them are independent.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>recall the negative value shift</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution2.cpp) |
| 3 | [Link](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc092/tasks/arc092_a) | adhoc | Div2C-ish | <details><summary>View</summary>In set<int, greater<int>>, the upper bound and lower bound functions act reverse. For example, lower bound returns the largest element less that or equal</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>recall the sorting based on x and left to right sweep with set maintainances</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution3.cpp) |
| 4 | [Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2192/) | Geometry | Div2D-ish | <details><summary>View</summary>The Ray Casting algorithm is used for Point-in-Polygon. The key is the 'General Position' principle: use a slightly tilted ray (e.g., to a point like {x+1, large_y}) to avoid ambiguous edge cases like hitting a vertex or a perfectly vertical/horizontal edge.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>Recall the two main bugs: 1) A vertical ray is fragile and fails on vertex cases. 2) Checking for collinear segment intersection requires an *overlap* check, not a *containment* check. Also, always use long long for cross products.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution4.cpp) |
| 5 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/621/problem/C) | Expected Value | Div2C |  |  | [Solution](./codes/solution5.cpp) |
| 6 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/312/problem/B) | Probability | Div2B | <details><summary>View</summary>Recognizing the repeating states and finding the recurrence relation or the geometric series. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series A + A*R + A*R^2 +... is A / (1 - R). This formula is valid as long as the absolute value of R is less than 1. Since R is a product of probabilities, it will always be between 0 and 1, so we can use the formula.</details> |  | [Solution](./codes/solution6.cpp) |
| 7 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/518/problem/D) | Probability and Expected Value | Div2D | <details><summary>View</summary>memset is a C-style function that works by setting each byte of a memory block to a specific value.<br><br>How memset Works: When you call memset(dp, -1, ...), it fills every single byte of the dp array with the byte pattern for -1, which is 0xFF in two's complement.<br><br>How long double is Stored: Floating-point numbers (like float, double, and long double) are not stored as simple integers. They are stored using a specific format (like IEEE 754), which has separate parts for the sign, the exponent, and the mantissa.<br><br>The Conflict: The byte pattern 0xFFFFFF... does not represent the number -1.0 in the floating-point standard. Instead, that specific bit pattern represents a NaN (Not a Number) value.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>Use visited array when dp stores real numbers. Also look into the base case in this implementation.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution7.cpp) |
| 8 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2149/problem/F) | Binary Search On Answer | Div3F |  | <details><summary>View</summary>Started coding without understanding statement clearly. It said each rest will increase health point by one and I missed this part and started writing a wrong solution.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution8.cpp) |
| 9 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2149/problem/G) | Randomization, Segment Tree | Div3G | <details><summary>View</summary>Always analyze bounds of answer. In this problem, the upper bound of answer was at most two candidates in each range.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>Recall why does randomization works in this problem and the math behind the probability. &lt;br&gt;Recall the calculation of the chance of failure.&lt;br&gt;Declaring a visited array inside each query costed TLE. Instead I could create candidates set for simplicity of the implementation.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution9.cpp) |
| 10 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2148/problem/G) | Number Theory | Div4G | <details><summary>View</summary>-Avoid unnecessary usage of sets if it can be handled with arrays with a few extra lines of code, specially when the complexity is tight-bound.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>-Recall the next vector maintenance for previous state's answer</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution10.cpp) |
| 11 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2152/problem/D) | Bitmask, Game Theory, Adhoc | Div2D |  | <details><summary>View</summary>Recall how the (2^k + 1) form numbers matter the most and how we will eventually get a (2^k + 1) form number from numbers those are not in the form 2^k initially.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution11.cpp) |
| 12 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2134/problem/D) | Tree Diameter, Adhoc | Div2D | <details><summary>View</summary>The diameter path can easily be stored using a parent array.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>I was coding to find the last discovered node instead of the furthest node to find diameter.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution12.cpp) |
| 13 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/161/problem/D) | DP on Tree | Div2D |  | <details><summary>View</summary>Recall how rerooting was unnecessary in this problem.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution13.cpp) |
| 14 | [Link](https://toph.co/c/preliminary-8th-drmc-intl-tech-carnival-2025) | DP on Tree / Centroid Decomposition | DIV2D/E |  | <details><summary>View</summary>didn't clear the global answer variables and missed the 0 state calculation</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution14.cpp) |
| 15 | [Link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1753) | KMP | Div2D | <details><summary>View</summary>If you ever forget KMP, remember this intuition:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When a mismatch happens, how much of the pattern have we already matched that can be reused as a prefix?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s exactly what pi function tells you.</details> |  | [Solution](./codes/solution15.cpp) |
| 16 | [Link](https://codeforces.com/gym/105925/problem/J) | Segment Tree Lazy | DIV2Eish | <details><summary>View</summary>the query optimization technique inside segment tree.</details> | <details><summary>View</summary>Recall the increase of k shifting to subtracting from the later values trick, reducing the complexity to log^2n to logn way, and need of two query functions and i was querying wrong thing to find the current value, also wrong update of lazy value.</details> | [Solution](./codes/solution16.cpp) |
